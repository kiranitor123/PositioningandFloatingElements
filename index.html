                    CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new
                    son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing
                    far beyond the world of known physics.

                    He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been
                    created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with.
                    A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a
                    special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed
                    of light for a prodigiously violent instant.

                <p class="mainContentFontSize">
                    If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to
                    pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and
                    irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit
                    in the ocean.

                    On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning

                    Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth,
                    wondered whether it could ever be proved.
                </p>
                <p class="mainContentFontSize">
                    If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent
                    discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast
                    realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.

                <p class="mainContentFontSize">
                    Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space
                    with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose
                    extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an
                    endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling
                    over.

                    the reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s
                    ripples would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s
                    theory of general relativity, should ruffle space-time.

                    Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the

                    The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that
                    permeates space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as

                The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth of observations and analysis.
                Eschewing email for fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select few,
                meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as is his son,
                Larry, who was sleeping that night in 1979), in his office last week.

                “And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was a delivery but we did not think that

                Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation that posits the clash of a pair of

                expressed reservations about inflation.

            <p class="mainContentFontSize">
                Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the need for confirmation, noting that

            </h3>
            <p class="mainContentFontSize">
                Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the cosmic microwaves, which were
                discovered accidentally by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the Nobel
                Prize.
            </p>
            <p class="mainContentFontSize">
                Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these waves. He is one of four leaders of
                Bicep, which has operated a series of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the South Pole, where
                the thin, dry air creates ideal observing conditions. The others are Clement Pryke of the University of
                Minnesota, Jamie Bock of the California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of Stanford.

            <p class="mainContentFontSize">
                “The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on the ground,” Dr. Kovac said. He has

                In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave radiation was polarized, meaning the
                light waves had a slight preference to vibrate in one direction rather than another.
            </p>
            <p class="mainContentFontSize">
                This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational waves from inflation. Such
                waves, squeezing space in one direction and stretching it in another as they go by, would twist the
                direction of polarization of the microwaves, theorists said. As a result, maps of the polarization in
                the sky should have little arrows going in spirals.
            </p>
            <p class="mainContentFontSize">
                Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small differences in the temperature of the
                microwaves. The group’s telescope, Bicep2, is basically a giant superconducting thermometer.

                The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they spent a year burning up time on a Harvard

                breakthrough.

                The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists like Dr. Guth, staying up late in his

            <p class="mainContentFontSize">
                As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall from grace, like some old folk
                mythology of gods or brothers falling out with each other. The laws of physics evolved, with one force
                after another splitting away.
            </p>
            <p class="mainContentFontSize">
                That was where Dr. Guth came in.
            </p>
            <p class="mainContentFontSize">
                Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the temperature falls below 32 degrees,
                until it is disturbed, at which point it will rapidly freeze, releasing latent heat.
            </p>
            <p class="mainContentFontSize">
                Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified state too long. In that case, space
                itself would become imbued with a mysterious latent energy.
            </p>
            <p class="mainContentFontSize">
                Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent energy would act as a kind of antigravity, and the
                universe would blow itself up. Since it was space itself supplying the repulsive force, the more space
                was created, the harder it pushed apart.
            </p>
            <p class="mainContentFontSize">
                What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at least a trillion trillionfold — from a
                submicroscopic speck of primordial energy to the size of a grapefruit — in less than a cosmic eye-blink.
            </p>
            <p class="mainContentFontSize">
                Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into ordinary particles and radiation. All of
                normal cosmic history was still ahead, resulting in today’s observable universe, a patch of sky and
                stars billions of light-years across. “It’s often said that there is no such thing as a free lunch,” Dr.
                Guth likes to say, “but the universe might be the ultimate free lunch.”
            </p>
            <p class="mainContentFontSize">
                Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting from Dr. Guth’s original vision
                suggest that inflation, once started, is eternal. Even as our own universe settled down to a comfortable
                homey expansion, the rest of the cosmos will continue blowing up, spinning off other bubbles endlessly,
                a concept known as the multiverse.
            </p>
            <p class="mainContentFontSize">
                So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do not bother asking about going any
                deeper into the past.
            </p>
            <p class="mainContentFontSize">
                We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very beginning, because inflation erases
                everything that came before it. All the chaos and randomness of the primordial moment are swept away,
                forever out of our view.
            </p>
            <p class="mainContentFontSize">
                “If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer who was not part
                of the team, “you wind up at inflation.”
